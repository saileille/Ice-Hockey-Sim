Some notes about the game:
 - Saving the game is not possible yet.
 - All teams start with no players, and you must have a full team (2 goalkeepers, 4 skaters in each position) before the first match of the season, or you risk a CtD.
 - You can only offer one contract per turn. There is an "Actions remaining" counter in the top bar.
 - You cannot renew contracts of players yet.
 - Players leave their teams at the end of the last day of their contract, meaning they can be signed the day after their contract is marked to expire.
 - I am aware the game is very barebones still, and there is plenty I plan to do still. It is an alpha version for a reason.

 Changelist:
  - Players grow older.
  - Players' ability changes.
  - Players retire (pretty randomly).
  - Teams get a few young players every year at the end of the season.
  - Added player age to team and scouting screen.
  - Added player birthday to player screen.
  - Made the name database not compile with the source code.
  - Fixed a visual bug where playoff wins were not visible.
  - Fixed a visual bug where latest results were showing the most recent ones and next games were showing the last scheduled games of the competition.
  - Fixed a visual bug where you could not see approached players in the team screen.

0.1.0-A:
 - First release.
