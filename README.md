## Some notes about the game:
 - Saving the game is not possible yet.
 - All teams start with only a few players, and you must have a full team (2 goalkeepers, 4 skaters in each position) before the first match of the season, or you risk a CtD.
 - You can only offer one contract per turn. There is an "Actions remaining" counter in the top bar.
 - You cannot renew contracts of players yet.
 - Players leave their teams at the end of the last day of their contract, meaning they can be signed the day after their contract is marked to expire.
 - I am aware the game is very barebones with plenty to work on. It is an alpha version for a reason.

 ## Changelist:
 - Fixed the player page title when player is under contract.
 - Added country flags.

  - Teams get a few young players every year at the end of the season.

  - Gave up on the idea of an iOS release for now.
  - Webview2 comes with the installer now, so Internet connection is not required for Windows users.
  - Fixed a visual bug where playoff wins were not visible.
  - Fixed a visual bug where latest results were showing the most recent ones and next games were showing the last scheduled games of the competition.
  - Fixed a visual bug where you could not see approached players in the team screen.
  - (Possibly) fixed $PATH variables not working correctly for Linux users.
  - *Should* work on Linux now.
